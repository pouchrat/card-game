# Card Game

A little personal project to create a simple card game. Repository name is subject to change.

## The Cards

Each card has:

- **A title**: The card's name.
- **An elemental type:** One of [air, earth, fire, water].
- **A value:** A number from 0-15.
- **Art:** An image representing the card.
- **Flavor text:** A short bit of writing without gameplay effects.
